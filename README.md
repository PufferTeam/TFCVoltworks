#  __**TFC Voltworks**__ 

Months of works is coming for a release of my personal modpack based on **TFC, Create and Immersive Engineering**. A fully **fledged technology tree**, from pottery and pit kilns, to charcoal production, producing iron with a bloomery, steel making and later on, with electric machines, rotational power and more.
Every Recipe from every modpack is tweaked to fit the TFC gameplay.
### __**Quests**__ 
The modpack will have **extensive questlines** to guide yourself in TerraFirmaCraft world and the **modpack progression**.

### __**Automation**__ 
In this pack, everything from the **TerraFirmaCraft** mod will be able to be **automated**! Automated Forging machines, Heating etc. Every aspect that is not normally automatable will have alternatives to be automated in Create/IE and** every machine in Create is compatible** with TFC (blaze burner is removed, replaced with Charcoal Forge, you can heat up items with fans)

The Progression includes **multiples goals**, with the goal of always being **automatable.**

###  __**Immersive Worldgen**__ 
**TerraFirmaCraft** completely **overhauls Minecraft world generation** - from adding plate tectonics, to flowing rivers, to mountain ranges, to varied and diverse forests, flora, and fauna.

The underground has been **completely reimagined**, with layers of different types of rock, and massive sparse ore deposits of several different types.

**The world is alive**, with many different plants, wild crops, wild fruits, animals - both passive and predators - to find
